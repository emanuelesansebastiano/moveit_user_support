PROJECT PURPOSE:
Library dedicated to improve MoveIt! pkg. MeveIt! is user friendly, but not enough, thanks to this library other functions where introduced to simplify user job.

This library has been design to cover Baxter robot necessities, but it can be easily modified to make them compatible with your robot by changing the macros of the header file (.h).

In  folder "data_files_examples" there is a file example to define the objects contained in the scene. This kind of file is readable by the the function "moveit_basics_functions::readCollisionObj".

!!!WARNING!!!
This package is continuously updated and the versions could mismatch.

ENJOY!!!!!!
